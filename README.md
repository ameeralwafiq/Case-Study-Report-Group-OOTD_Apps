## 1. Project Initiation
### a) Title 
- The title for our proposed mobile application is 'OOTD'.

### b) Background of the problem
- Clothing is essential to daily life, reflecting our culture, environment, and identity. Beyond providing comfort and protection, clothes also serves as a form of self-expression and symbolizes roles, traditions, or status. Either way, human's are very close to their wearings than other things because that is what they will be thinking first before do any other tasks.

- As fashion evolves, the rising demand for clothing highlights concerns about sustainability and ethical values. With Americans now buying an average of 53 new items per year — four times as much as in 2000 — the fashion industry increasingly reflects not just personal identity but also broader environmental challenges. The more challenging problem is that, people are buying clothes that are not crucial for them and most of the time they have it already at home, some of them are not even weared once. Furthermore, tons of clothes are ending up as a waste making buying new clothes nowadays is not really sustainable and environmentally friendly. (Textiles: Material-Specific Data | US EPA, 2024)

- By having a platform where people can keep track their clothes seamlessly and knowing which items are rarely used, they could lessen their temptation to buy new clothes and increase the usage of their catalogs of clothes in a daily basis.

### c) Purpose
- The three main purpose for our application that reflects the problems arise in the global community:
  1. To reduce temptation of people to buy new clothes.
  2. To help people ease their clothes management.
  3. To further help user keep track of their individual clothes.

### d) Target User
- There are several specific target users for our applications;
  1. Fashion Designer
  2. Corporate Adults
  3. Social Media Influencers
  4. ?

- Other target users will be the general population ranging from 18 to 60 years old that using Android smartphones.

### e) Preferred Platform
- The preferred platform for the 'OOTD' application is Android. There are several reasons as to why Android is being chosen as the application's platform;
1. Firstly, Android has a great market reach and very suitable for a developing application to penetrate the market and compete with other similar applications. (Ref...)
2. Second, the platform has one of the widest community for developing applications in its platform, making it faster and easier to develop application in this platform with lots of tips, step-by-step walkthroughs, issue debugging and etc.

### f) Features & Functionalities
#### 1. Outfit Saving and Cataloging
- This main feature will allow users to snap and upload photos of their outfits/individual clothing items and to organise those into categories e.g. tops, bottoms, shoes, accessories, etc.
#### 2. Clothing Matching Assistance
- Provide mix-and-match feature to help users create new outfit combinations by randomising each categories. Users chosen outfit will be recorded and stored in database for analytics.
#### 3. Wardrobe Insights Dashboard
- SHow basic analytics such as; most frequently worn items, least used tops/bottoms/shoes/accessories, total tops/bottoms/shoes/accessories, and also 'Favorites', which user can decide to use and recorded by the application.
