## 1. Project Initiation
### a) Title 
- The title for our proposed mobile application is 'OOTD'.

### b) Background of the problem
- Clothing is essential to daily life, reflecting our culture, environment, and identity. Beyond providing comfort and protection, clothes also serves as a form of self-expression and symbolizes roles, traditions, or status. Either way, human's are very close to their wearings than other things because that is what they will be thinking first before do any other tasks.

- As fashion evolves, the rising demand for clothing highlights concerns about sustainability and ethical values. With Americans now buying an average of 53 new items per year — four times as much as in 2000 — the fashion industry increasingly reflects not just personal identity but also broader environmental challenges. The more challenging problem is that, people are buying clothes that are not crucial for them and most of the time they have it already at home, some of them are not even weared once. Furthermore, tons of clothes are ending up as a waste making buying new clothes nowadays is not really sustainable and environmentally friendly. (Textiles: Material-Specific Data | US EPA, 2024)

- By having a platform where people can keep track their clothes seamlessly and knowing which items are rarely used, they could lessen their temptation to buy new clothes and increase the usage of their catalogs of clothes in a daily basis.

### c) Purpose
- To reduce temptation of people to buy new clothes.
- To help people ease their clothes management.
- To further help user keep track of their individual clothes.
